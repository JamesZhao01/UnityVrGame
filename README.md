# UnityVrGame

Source code for a one-month long capstone project, developing a VR game from scratch from start to finish.
This project wasn't meant to be done well/continuously worked on, mainly meant to try to learn Unity & SteamVR in one month and to have something to show for it.
It is probably filled with bugs, spaghetti code, and glitches.
